**Motion App** is a fitness tracking application built with Vue.js, Express.js, & SQL. Designed as a final project for a software engineering program at **Humana XCA**, this app was developed to combine my passion for fitness with my dedication to creating impactful software. Motion App enables users to create and manage workouts, track sets, reps, weights, and view workout history. The app also includes a custom exercise database, workout templates for quick starts (work in progess), and easy access to exercise list.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with JWT-based authentication.
- **Workout Tracking**: Users can create workouts, add exercises, track sets and reps, and view workout history.
- **Exercise Database**: Browse exercises by target muscles or equipment, with options to filter and search.
- **Template Workouts (WIP)**: Start pre-defined or frequently-used workout templates for quick access.
- **Real-Time Data Management**: Local storage is used to retain workout data on the client-side for an improved user experience.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with a mobile-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

• Frontend: Vue.js, Pinia (state management), Tailwind CSS, Phosphor Icons
• Backend: Express.js, PostgreSQL, JWT (for authentication)
• Other Tools: LocalStorage (for workout persistence), dotenv (environment management)
